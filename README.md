# D++ Shoto Bot

This project represents an attempt at porting CitricRain's shouto-bot project from discord.js to D++, a C++ Discord API Bot Library that's lightweight and scalable for small and huge bots.

In addition to porting this bot to almost the same stuff as the original, it will have several changes (e.g. newly-introduced slash commands instead of 's!'-prefixed commands).

This bot's base is brainboxdotcc's windows-bot-template DPP bot template, thus the required IDE for this project is Visual Studio 2022.
